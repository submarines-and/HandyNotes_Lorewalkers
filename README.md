# handynotes-lorewalkers-bfa
Modified version of Lorewalker node addon that works with BFA+

Many of the objectives in `krasarang wilds` are wrong due to patch changes. They have usually been moved slightly, but you should be able to find them if you circulate. They are usually pretty obvious (e.g. larger statues, glowing scrolls).


To install:
* Download repository
* Rename folder `HandyNotes_Lorewalkers`
* Move to your `addons` folder
